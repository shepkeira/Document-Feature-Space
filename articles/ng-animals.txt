Climate change will eventually alter where bamboo (giant pandas' primary food source) and eucalyptus (koalas' primary food source) can grow, which could shrink habitats in the future. Here's how you can help save energy—and protect these animals:

• Turn off the lights when you leave a room.

• Hang up your freshly washed clothes to dry.

• Walk or bike as much as you can instead of driving.
FLORIDA MANATEES NEED YOU!

Here's how you can protect these marine mammals:

• If you see manatees in the wild, don't give them food or water. Feeding them encourages the mammals to swim too close to boats.

• Stash your trash so manatees won't get entangled in it.

• If you live near water, ask your parents not to use fertilizer on your lawn. It can dump extra nutrients into the water system, creating wildlife-killing algae blooms in rivers and ocean.

Here's how you can help save these primates:

• Visit zoos approved by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA); part of your entry fee will be donated to conservation causes.

• Look for products that have a label confirming their ingredients were grown in a rainforest-friendly way.

• Work a lemonade stand and donate the proceeds to a group that supports tamarin conservation.

Here's how you can help save rhinos:

• Avoid souvenirs made from endangered animal parts, including rhino horn.

• Tell all your friends about cute rhino calves and why they're in trouble.

GRAY WOLVES NEED YOU!

Here's how you can protect these canines:

• Many people don't know that wolves are in trouble. Write a school report, draw a poster, or just howl about how cool they are to all your friends.

• Keep pets indoors: Conflict between pets and predators makes people less likely to want to protect wolves.

• Learn about how the Endangered Species Act protects gray wolves and other animals in North America and around the world.
