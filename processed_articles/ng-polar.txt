the narwhal is tusk can grow to nine feet three meters long
polar habitat
it is frigid and you are surrounded by ice
you wonder how any animal could survive in this extreme cold
then a polar bear and her cubs lumber by and in the ocean behind them a whale erupts from the water

polar habitats cover the top and bottom of planet earth at the north and south poles
the north pole is surrounded by the arctic ocean
there isn not any land here just a group of continually shifting ice sheets
parts of canada and greenland are near the north pole
the south pole is located on antarctica
this area has land but it is completely covered with a layer of ice that is almost three miles thick in some places
brrrr

it is cold at the poles
in the arctic the average winter temperature is about around minus f
at the south pole it is even colder
the lowest temperature ever recordedminus fwas in antarctica
even though it is chilly in polar regions they do have seasonswell two seasons
summer and winter
in the summer the sun shines hours a day but it never gets high enough above the horizon to warm things up so even summers are pretty cold
it is dark all winter at the poles because the sun doesn not rise during those months of the year
fierce continuous winds make it feel even colder
you will see plenty of snow at the poles but little rain
antarctica and parts of the arctic are actually considered deserts because of the lack of rainfall
growing season
polar bear cub climbing on mom is back
it is much too cold and dry for trees to grow in most areas of the arctic and there is no room for their roots because just under the surface of the ground there is always a layer of ice called permafrost
but in some places called tundras a thin layer of soil on the top of the permafrost thaws just a little in summer and grasses and mosses grow above the ice for a few months
in summer arctic poppies bloom making the tundra bright yellow
you won not find trees in antarctica but some types of small shrubs lichens mosses and algae are able to grow in the harsh climate
animals
cute polar bear in a snow bank
polar bears and arctic foxes are adapted to the extreme weather of the arctic region
walruses and humpback whales live in the arctic ocean
several kinds of penguins including the emperor penguin live in antarctica and so do walruses and narwhals
the poles of the planet are places of extremes
they are extremely cold extremely dry and have extremely long days and nights
and if you visit be sure to wear extremely warm clothing
