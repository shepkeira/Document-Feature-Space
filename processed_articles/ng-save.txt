13 ways to save the earth from climate change
easy ways to help
we know you love watching videos on your phone
but modern activities such as plugging in devices driving cars and cooling homesoften rely on energy sources such as natural gas oil and coal
those energy sources release a gas called carbon dioxide co2 into the atmosphere
when co2 and other greenhouse gases trap heat that would otherwise escape earth is atmosphere the planet is temperature rises
that is called global warming which causes climate change
most scientists believe that climate change is happening and causing rising seas stronger storms and shifting habitats for wildlife and people
but you don not have to give up videos or totally shut down the ac to fight climate change
read on to learn how you can help
used goods are good
reduce and reuse as much as possible
factories emit carbon dioxide when making new products
so instead of buying new stuff fix your appliances and clothes
good thing holey jeans are back in style
send a postcard
send a letter postcard or drawing to your mayor government representative or even the president asking them to do something about climate change
slay the vampire

close the door
if you see a business with its door wide open in the summer ask an adult to help you email or talk to an employee about closing it
an open door to an airconditioned building can let 2
2 tons of carbon dioxide escape over one summer
that is about as much as a car on a 5000 mile road trip
season your fruit

hang up and reuse your hotel towels instead of washing them after each use
that saves water and energy
walk it out
walk or bike as much as you can
biking or walking just one mile a day for a year could save 330 pounds of carbon dioxidethat is the same as planting four trees and letting them grow for 10 years
spread the word
write a letter to the editor about climate change in your local or school newspaper
the more people talk about the issue the better
stay cool
wear a warm sweater instead of turning up the heat and open your windows and turn on a fan instead of blasting the air conditioner
