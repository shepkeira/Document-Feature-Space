tardigrade
you can boil them bake them deepfreeze them crush them dehydrate them or even blast them into space
it doesn not mattertardigrades can survive practically anything
these eightlegged aquatic animals may be small but they are nearly indestructible
common name
tardigrades
scientific name
tardigrada
diet
omnivore
size
millimeter
tiny but tough
in fact these invertebrates are so tiny you need a microscope to be able to see them
but despite being smaller than a poppy seed tardigrades look pretty fierce when you view them up close
they have claws like bears and daggerlike teeth that tear into and suck the juices out of moss and algae
they have even been nicknamed water bears for their resemblance to the furry predators
tardigrades can be found almost anywhere on earth from the top of the himalaya mountain range to the bottom of the sea from icy antarctica to bubbling hot springs
the teenytiny creatures can survive extreme temperatures ranging from minus f up to f
tardigrades need only a drop of water to thrive
no water
no problem
without access to water a tardigrade will curl up into a dry ball called a tun
their body systems slow down so much that they are almostbut not quitedead
the tiny animals can survive like this for decades
scientists call this extreme type of hibernation cryptobiosis
when they are reexposed to water tardigrades can come back to life in just a few hours
once when dried moss that had been in a museum for a hundred years was moistened tardigrades inside the moss came crawling out totally fine
tardigrades spend most of their time snacking on plants and bacteria
they have to be careful though
although tardigrades can survive extreme conditions they still have predators
nematodes a kind of worm amoebas and sometimes even other tardigrades all prey on tardigrades
get ready to meet two extreme animals that are able to stay alive in the craziest of conditions
bears in space
tardigrades haven not only survived extreme conditions on earth
they are the first animals to survive the vacuum that means no air radiation blasts and freezing temperatures of space
in scientists placed the tiny critters into a satellite and shot them into space
there they floated in special containers miles above sea level for days before plummeting back to earth
upon inspection most of the water bears were ok
they had survived radiation blasts times stronger than the sun is rays on earth
tardigrades are helping scientists rethink what they know about what it takes to survive in extreme conditionsand what humans might need to survive on another planet
fast facts
tardigrades have been on earth for about million years about million years before dinosaurs
tardigrades are sometimes called moss piglets
tardigrade eggs take between and days to hatch
