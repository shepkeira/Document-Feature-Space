understanding semisupervised learning
semisupervised learningssl is one of the artificial intelligenceai methods that have become popular in the last few months
companies such as google have been advancing the tools and frameworks relevant for building semisupervised learning applications
google expander is a great example of a tool that reflects the advancements in semisupervised learning applications
conceptually semisupervised learning can be positioned halfway between unsupervised and supervised learning models
a semisupervised learning problem starts with a series of labeled data points as well as some data point for which labels are not known
the goal of a semisupervised model is to classify some of the unlabeled data using the labeled information set
some ai practitioners see semisupervised learning as a form of supervised learning with additional information
at the end the goal of semisupervised learning models is to sesame as supervised ones
to predict a target value for a specific input data set
alternatively other segments of the ai community see semisupervised learning as a form of unsupervised learning with constraints

semisupervised learning in the real world
semisupervised learning models are becoming widely applicable in scenarios across a large variety of industries
let is explore a few of the most wellknown examples
speech analysis
speech analysis is a classic example of the value of semisupervised learning models
labeling audio files typically is a very intensive tasks that requires a lot of human resources
applying ssl techniques can really help to improve traditional speech analytic models
protein sequence classification
inferring the function of proteins typically requires active human intervention
web content classification
organizing the knowledge available iun billions of web pages will advance different segments of ai
unfortunately that task typically requires human intervention to classify the content
there are plenty of other scenarios for ssl models
however not all ai scenarios can directly be tackled using ssl
there are a few essential characteristics that should be present on a problem to be effectively solvable using ssl
1sizable unlabeled dataset
in ssl scenarios the seize of the unlabeled dataset should be substantially bigger than the labeled data
otherwise the problem can be simply addressed using supervised algorithms
2inputoutput proximity symmetry
ssl operates by inferring classification for unlabeled data based on proximity with labeled data points
inverting that reasoning ssl scenarios entail that if two data points are part of the same cluster determined by a kmeans algo or similar their outputs are likely to be in close proximity as well
complementarily if two data points are separated by a low density area their output should not be close
3relatively simple labeling lowdimension nature of the problem
in ssl scenarios it is important that the inference of the labeled data doesn not become a problem more complicated than the original problem
this is known in ai circles as the vapnik principle which essentially states that in order to solve a problem we should not pick an intermediate problem of a higher order of complexity
also problems that use datasets with many dimensions or attributes are likely to become really challenging for ssl algorithms as the labeling task will become very complex
in a future post i will cover some of the fundamental types of ssl algorithms
